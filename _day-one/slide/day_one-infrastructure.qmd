### Lesson Objectives

#### To be able to

- Activate, restore, a work on an RStudio projects.
- Use the `{here}` package and its `?here::here` function to find files and folders within a project.
- Describe the difference from a library and a package, in R.
- Describe the purpose of the `{renv}` package/system.
- Create a project powered by `{renv}`, both from RStudio IDE and using `?renv::init`
- Use the main three instructions in `{renv}`, i.e., `?renv::status`, `?renv::snapshot`, and `?renv::restore`
- Organize a project in folder, in particular understand and be able to use the standard structure of (`renv/`) `R/`, `data-raw/`, and `data/`, with optional folders for `analyses/`, and `dev/`.
- Understand the role, and don't be scared, of additional folders like `tests`.
