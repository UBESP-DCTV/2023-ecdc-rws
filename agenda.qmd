## Intro

The course will alternate between face-to-face presentations and exercises (15-20 minute each) on the covered topics. Next, the instructor will provide the "official" answer to the challenge. That not only offers a comparative learning experience but also sets the stage for the next topic. Each new chapter begins in a collaborative environment, with the official solution to the previous challenge implemented, ensuring a smooth transition and cohesive learning path.

At the end of each day, participants will have the option to tackle an longer hands-on exercise covering the day's topics; the solution will be discussed and presented in the first half-hour of the next class.

At the end of the course, we will suggest a comprehensive exercise to be done independently at home. We will also send a questionnaire to participants to assess the retention of the concepts presented in the course.

The whole course will be conducted using the R programming languages [@R-base], and it will introduce the main **Tidyverse** [@tidyverse2019] R-package ecosystem and philosophy for a uniform, composable, functional, and human-first design utilities to do data science. In particular, the following packages will be introduced and used during the course:

-   the `{tidyverse}` [@R-tidyverse] to activate the ecosystem on the R session

-   the RStudio projects, and the `{renv}` [@R-renv], and `{here}` [@R-here] packages for project management, reproducibility, and portability. On their side, there will be introduced the native *pipe*, with only mentioning the {magrittr} \[\@R-magrittr\], to pipe instructions in an easy-to-write/read/understand way.

-   `{ggplot2}` [@R-ggplot2] for graphics production

-   the `{rio}` [@R-rio] for data reading/import and writing/export

-   `{janitor}` [@R-janitor], and `{tidyr}` [@R-tidyr] for data cleaning at import level, and the `{dplyr}` [@R-dplyr], `{forcats}` [@R-forcats], `{lubridate}` [@R-lubridate], and (optionally at teh end of teh course) `{stringr}` [@R-stringr], and `{glue}` [@R-glue] for post-import data sets and type-specific data manipulation and management.

-   `{gtsummary}` [@R-gtsummary] to create summary tables for data and models and to include table data in a report's narrative text sections directly, i.e., without copy-pasting them by hand.[^1]

[^1]: The `{flextable}` [@R-flextable] package will be not introduced explicitly because `{gtsummary}` can now manage MS Word tables as well. On the other side, it will be explained how to convert a `gtsummary` table on other formats, `flextable` included.

<!-- -->

-   R Markdown [@R-rmarkdown], `{knitr}` [@R-knitr], and Quarto [@R-quarto] to create reproducible, dynamic documents such as reports, articles, slides, and much more.
