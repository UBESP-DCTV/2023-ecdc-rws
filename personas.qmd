## Persona 1: Ricky Report

::: {.panel-tabset group="a"}
## General Background

Ricky is a senior epidemiologist and a supervisor at the National Public Health Institute of Country X. He has a Master's in Public Health focusing on Epidemiology from a reputed institution. Over his 10-year career, Ricky has been actively involved in field epidemiology, particularly outbreak investigations and health surveillance systems. He understands the importance of data in informing public health actions and has basic knowledge of statistical tools.

## Relevant Experiences

He has a basic understanding of R and data manipulation but has relied chiefly on other statistical software like SAS for his work. Ricky is competent in fundamental data analysis but is a novice in using the Tidyverse package in R and constructing tables and images for reporting.

## (Their perceived!) needs

Ricky perceives the need to upskill in R, particularly in using Tidyverse for data manipulation and visualization, to ensure efficient and effective analysis and reporting. He is also keen on learning R Markdown to generate reproducible and presentable reports. Ricky believes mastering these skills will enhance his capacity and enable him to effectively support and train regional and local level staff.

## Special Considerations

As a supervisor, Ricky must balance his time between administrative duties, fieldwork, and learning. He is also responsible for mentoring MediPIET fellows, so he's keen on gaining hands-on skills that he can easily pass on to his mentees.
