# Cleaning imported data

## Standard data issues

Often, when data where collected in real life in Excel, they do not have an optimal shape for importing them into programs.

::: columns
::: {.column width="50%"}
You can have:

-   leading header's groups
-   empty columns and rows
-   multi-line headers
-   space and special characters in names
-   missing information
-   repeated-data reported at first occurrence only

## Your turn

-   Connect to our [pad](https://bit.ly/ubep-rws-pad-ed2)(<https://bit.ly/ubep-rws-pad-3ed>)

1.  List all other issue you have ever encounter in importing/cleaning data (or you can imagine could happen, if this is the first time you import data on software for data analyses)
:::

```{r}
#| echo: false
countdown(
  minutes = 1,
  left = "45%",
  right = "5%",
  top = "70%",
  bottom = 0,
  blink_colon = TRUE,
  play_sound = TRUE,
  margin = "5%",
  font_size = "4em"
)
```

## Headers - skip-them-all {auto-animate="true"}

We can completely skip the headers, and manually assign col names

::: callout-tip
`rio::import` useful options:

-   `skip = n`: ignore first n lines
-   `header = FALSE` = doesn't use (first-line-after-skipped) data to create headers.
:::

```{r}
db_raw <- here("data-raw", "Copenhagen_raw.xlsx") |> 
  # ignore first 4 lines
  # do not any header in import
  import(skip = 4, header = FALSE)
db_raw
```

## Headers - manual defined headers {auto-animate="true"}

We can completely skip the headers, and manually assign col names

::: callout-tip
`rio::import` useful options:

-   `skip = n`: ignore first n lines
-   `header = FALSE` = doesn't use (first-line-after-skipped) data to create headers.
:::

```{r}
#| code-line-numbers: "6-12"
db_raw <- here("data-raw", "Copenhagen_raw.xlsx") |> 
  # ignore first 4 lines
  # do not any header in import
  import(skip = 4, header = FALSE)

# so we can define proper name manually...
col_names <- paste(
  sample(letters, 43, replace = TRUE),
  1:43,
  sep = "_"
)
col_names
```

## Headers - set manual headers {auto-animate="true"}

We can completely skip the headers, and manually assign col names

::: callout-tip
`rio::import` useful options:

-   `skip = n`: ignore first n lines
-   `header = FALSE` = doesn't use (first-line-after-skipped) data to create headers.
:::

```{r}
#| code-line-numbers: "13-14"
db_raw <- here("data-raw", "Copenhagen_raw.xlsx") |> 
  # ignore first 4 lines
  # do not any header in import
  import(skip = 4, header = FALSE)

# so we can define proper name manually...
col_names <- paste(
  sample(letters, 43, replace = TRUE),
  1:43,
  sep = "_"
)

names(db_raw) <- col_names
db_raw
```

## Headers - `{unheadr}` {auto-animate="true"}

The `{unheadr}` package purpose is exactly: "...functions to work with messy data, often derived from spreadsheets...", in particular, its `?unheadr::mash_colnames` makes many header rows into column names.

::: columns
::: {.column width="30%"}
::: callout-important
For `{unheadr}` to work, the best option is to `rio::import` all the data **without considering any structure**, so that with `header = FALSE` activated. If so, we can keep `n_name_rows = n` with `n` exactly equal to the number of rows that compose the header.
:::

::: callout-tip
## Note

-   All the spreadsheet content is imported as data, and all columns are parsed as `character`s.
-   Actual column names are meaningless now, so we will set `keep_names = FALSE`.
:::
:::

::: {.column width="70%"}
```{r}
#| code-line-numbers: "10"
library(rio)
library(here)
library(unheadr)
options(rio.import.class = "tibble")

here(
  "data-raw",
  "Copenhagen_raw.xlsx"
) |> 
  import(header = FALSE)
```

::: callout-caution
## What's next

First topmost header row is a grouping name for columns. In Excel, reported in the first column of each group (even if cells are merged).
:::
:::
:::

## Headers - `{unheadr}` {auto-animate="true"}

The `{unheadr}` package purpose is exactly: "...functions to work with messy data, often derived from spreadsheets...", in particular, its `?unheadr::mash_colnames` makes many header rows into column names.

::: columns
::: {.column width="30%"}
::: callout-important
If we have a (single!) topmost leading rows of grouping column names, and we like to maintain them (otherwise `skip = 1`), we will activate the option `sliding_headers = TRUE`. Setting the `n_name_rows = n` accordingly.
:::

::: callout-tip
## Note

-   The group column names are repeated forward to all the empty columns up to the next non empty one.
:::
:::

::: {.column width="70%"}
```{r}
#| code-line-numbers: "11-15"
library(rio)
library(here)
library(unheadr)
options(rio.import.class = "tibble")

here(
  "data-raw",
  "Copenhagen_raw.xlsx"
) |> 
  import(header = FALSE) |> 
  mash_colnames(
    keep_names = FALSE,
    n_name_rows = 1,
    sliding_headers = TRUE
  )
```

::: callout-caution
## What's next

We need to include all the other three header rows in the colnames, merging them with the corresponding group name.
:::
:::
:::

## Headers - `{unheadr}` {auto-animate="true"}

The `{unheadr}` package purpose is exactly: "...functions to work with messy data, often derived from spreadsheets...", in particular, its `?unheadr::mash_colnames` makes many header rows into column names.

::: columns
::: {.column width="30%"}
::: callout-important
Including in `n_name_rows = n` all the rows composing the header(s) (topmost grouping one eventually included!), `{unheadr}` will merge them all using underscores (i.e., `_`) to separate words.
:::

::: callout-tip
## Note

-   Considering all the rows composing the header is enough to complete the import.

This way, even if multiple column have the same name on distinct groups, we keep distinct column names in our imported dataset!
:::
:::

::: {.column width="70%"}
```{r}
#| code-line-numbers: "13"
library(rio)
library(here)
library(unheadr)
options(rio.import.class = "tibble")

here(
  "data-raw",
  "Copenhagen_raw.xlsx"
) |> 
  import(header = FALSE) |> 
  mash_colnames(
    keep_names = FALSE,
    n_name_rows = 4,
    sliding_headers = TRUE
  )
```

::: callout-caution
## What's next

Now that we have merged all the rows reporting column names components, it is extremely useful to guarantee that naming are syntactically correct and with a consistent convention across the dataset.
:::
:::
:::

## Variable names {auto-animate="true"}

`{janitor}` can also convert colnames consistently in a specific convention.[^1]

[^1]: *snake_case* by default. See the [Artwork](img/cases.jpeg) by [Allison Horst](https://allisonhorst.com/).

```{r}
#| code-line-numbers: "4,17"
library(rio)
library(here)
library(unheadr)
library(janitor)
options(rio.import.class = "tibble")

here(
  "data-raw",
  "Copenhagen_raw.xlsx"
) |> 
  import(header = FALSE) |> 
  mash_colnames(
    keep_names = FALSE,
    n_name_rows = 4,
    sliding_headers = TRUE
  ) |> 
  clean_names()
```

::: callout-caution
## What's next

Now colnames are fine, but still some empty column and rows in the dataset, we would like to remove to have a clean structure.
:::

## Empty rows and columns {auto-animate="true"}

We can use `{janitor}` package to remove empty columns and rows.

```{r}
#| code-line-numbers: "18"
library(rio)
library(here)
library(unheadr)
library(janitor)
options(rio.import.class = "tibble")

here(
  "data-raw",
  "Copenhagen_raw.xlsx"
) |> 
  import(header = FALSE) |> 
  mash_colnames(
    keep_names = FALSE,
    n_name_rows = 4,
    sliding_headers = TRUE
  ) |> 
  clean_names() |> 
  remove_empty(c("rows", "cols"))
```

::: callout-caution
## What's next

We have finished working on meta-data now. We can start to look at the data them self. First, `demo_sex` column as implicit repeated values we would like to make explicit.
:::

## Fill default content {auto-animate="true"}

```{r}
#| code-line-numbers: "5,20"
library(rio)
library(here)
library(unheadr)
library(janitor)
library(tidyverse)
options(rio.import.class = "tibble")

here(
  "data-raw",
  "Copenhagen_raw.xlsx"
) |> 
  import(header = FALSE) |> 
  mash_colnames(
    keep_names = FALSE,
    n_name_rows = 4,
    sliding_headers = TRUE
  ) |> 
  clean_names() |> 
  remove_empty(c("rows", "cols")) |> 
  fill(demo_sex)
```

::: callout-important
To fill the implicit content within the data, we can use the `{tidyr}` package, which is part of the `{tidyverse}`, and automatically attached by it.
:::

::: callout-caution
## What's next

We are quite to the end, we only need to make consistent convention for missing information. They are both reported as empty (already parsed as `NA`, correctly) and with `??`. We need to tell `rio::import` that also them are missing information
:::

## Missing data {auto-animate="true"}

```{r}
#| code-line-numbers: "14"
library(rio)
library(here)
library(unheadr)
library(janitor)
library(tidyverse)
options(rio.import.class = "tibble")

here(
  "data-raw",
  "Copenhagen_raw.xlsx"
) |> 
  import(
    header = FALSE,
    na = c("", "??")
  ) |> 
  mash_colnames(
    keep_names = FALSE,
    n_name_rows = 4,
    sliding_headers = TRUE
  ) |> 
  clean_names() |> 
  remove_empty(c("rows", "cols")) |> 
  fill(demo_sex)
```

1.  Open the script `09-clean.R` and follow the instruction step by step.

::: {.fragment .fade-out fragment-index="1"}
```{r}
#| echo: false
countdown(
  minutes = 25,
  left = "25%",
  right = "25%",
  top = "70%",
  bottom = 0,
  blink_colon = TRUE,
  play_sound = TRUE,
  margin = "5%",
  font_size = "4em"
)
```
:::

::: {.fragment .fade-in fragment-index="1"}
::: callout-important
Most often you will not have to manage multi-row header nor implicit information. Depending on your data, missing information can be coded not with simple empty cells, so that you would need to set `na = c()` explicitly. On the other hand, the pattern

``` r
library(rio)
library(here)
library(janitor)

db <- here(<path>) |> 
  import() |> 
  clean_names() |> 
  remove_empty(c("rows", "cols"))
```

will be quite standard anytime!
