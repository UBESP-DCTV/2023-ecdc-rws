He is also keen on learning R Markdown to generate reproducible and presentable reports. Ricky believes mastering these skills will enhance his capacity and enable him to effectively support and train regional and local level staff.\n\n\nAs a supervisor, Ricky must balance his time between administrative duties, fieldwork, and learning. He is also responsible for mentoring MediPIET fellows, so he’s keen on gaining hands-on skills that he can easily pass on to his mentees."

Ricky is competent in fundamental data analysis but is a novice in using the Tidyverse package in R and constructing tables and images for reporting.\n\n\nRicky perceives the need to upskill in R, particularly in using Tidyverse for data manipulation and visualization, to ensure efficient and effective analysis and reporting. He is also keen on learning R Markdown to generate reproducible and presentable reports. Ricky believes mastering these skills will enhance his capacity and enable him to effectively support and train regional and local level staff.\n\n\nAs a supervisor, Ricky must balance his time between administrative duties, fieldwork, and learning.
