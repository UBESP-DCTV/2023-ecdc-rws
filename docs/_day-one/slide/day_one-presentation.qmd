# Objectives and Philosophy

## Main Objective

The training course is expected to cover an introduction to R for:

-   data management
-   analysis
-   visualization

## Leading philosophy

-   We are not professional programmers.
-   We spend more time understanding rough code than writing it cleanly directly.
-   We gain more enthusiasm from (even small) practical results than from theory.
-   We'll learn better by doing, and we cannot become professionals from beginners attending a single course (that task requires 10000 hours of practice, more or less... [@wong2015]).

## So...

-   We will present small pieces of concepts each time.

-   We will ask you questions often.

-   We will ask you to write and execute code at incremental stages of each topic.

-   We will assign you homework for *the* *next* lesson to discuss together.

3.  Passive-interactive-active cycles.

4.  wrap up, summary, and concept map.

5.  Homework assignment presentation.
:::

::: {.column width="50%"}
-   **Passive**: slide presentation with sample code and suggestion.

    ```{r}
    #| eval: false
    #| code-line-numbers: "1,2"

    ```

    ::: callout-tip
    -   You *inject* (`|>`) the previous code's result into the subsequent function call
    -   You *add* (`+`) layers to a plot.
    :::

-   **Interactive**: questions for you to answer.

# R/RStudio

## R

-   A language: we write R code in the R language.

    ``` r
    two <- sum(1 + 1)
    ```

. . .

-   An Engine: able to execute computations, analyses, graphs, reports, ...

    ```{r}
    #| output-location: column
    library(tidyverse)

    mtcars |> 
      ggplot(aes(hp, mpg)) +
      geom_point(aes(colour = cyl)) +
      labs(
        x = "Gross horsepower",
        y = "Miles/(US) gallon",
        colour = "N cylinders"
      )
    ```

. . .

-   An Interpreter (that translates back-and-forth R code to executable code)

    -   When we *run* code in R language, the interpreter translates it for execution.
    -   When R has computed the results, the interpreter translates/prints it back to us.

    ```{r}
    sum(1:3)
    ```

## Rstudio

## The Tidyverse

The tidyverse is an opinionated collection of R packages designed for data science. All packages share an underlying design philosophy, grammar, and data structures.

<br>

::: columns
::: {.column width="28%"}
### Design Principles

-   Reuse existing data structures.
-   Compose simple functions with the pipe.
-   Embrace functional programming.
-   [Design for humans]{style="background-color: yellow;"}.
:::

::: {.column width="70%"}
### Packages

-   `{ggplot2}`: create data visualizations using the Grammar of Graphics.
-   `{dplyr}`: a set of verbs to solve data manipulation challenges.
-   `{tidyr}`: a set of functions that help you get to tidy data.
-   `{readr}`: a fast and friendly way to read rectangular data
-   `{purrr}`: a consistent tools suite for functional programming.
-   `{tibble}`: a modern re-imagining of the data frame.
-   `{stringr}`: a set of functions to work with strings as easy as possible.
-   `{forcats}`: a tool suite that solves common problems with factors.
-   `{lubridate}`: a tool suite to work with dates and date-times.
