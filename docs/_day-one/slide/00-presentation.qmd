# Course organization,<br>Teaching materials, and<br>Personalized assistance

## 

### Main Objective

The training course is expected to cover an introduction to R for exploratory data analysis (EDA): data management, tabular descriptive analysis, and visualization.

<br>

::: columns
::: {.column width="50%"}
### Teaching Philosophy

-   We are not professional programmers.
-   We spend more time understanding rough code than writing it cleanly directly.
-   We gain more enthusiasm from (even small) practical results than from theory.
-   We'll learn better by doing, and cannot become professionals from beginners attending a single course.[^1]
-   We solve problems better in groups than alone.
:::

::: {.column width="50%"}
### So we will

-   Present small pieces of concepts at a time.

-   Select packages, functions, and coding styles to prioritize the ease of understanding.

-   Ask you questions often and write and execute code at incremental stages of each topic.

-   Assign you homework for *the* *next* lesson to discuss together.\
    <br>

-   Provide platforms to answer and discuss collaboratively.
:::

    -   The task requires 10000 hours of practice, more or less. [@wong2015]

### Assistance

-   **Technical Assistance**: no infrastructural technical assistance will be provided during the session by UBEP staff. Please contact your ECDC IT staff for this matter.

-   **Rstudio Cloud Assistance:** write on Teams chat, and a person from UBEP will contact you directly on a separate Teams meeting

-   **Coding issues and questions**: feel free to discuss and collaborate on the pad's chat

-   **Local installation of R/RStudio**: Local installation is not required for the course, and we won't teach the course on your local installation. However, if you want to install R and RStudio on your computer, we will provide you instructions and support (possibly after the course). Please, contact the supporting staff for this matter during the class, or the administrative staff after the course.

## Slides

-   From the website ([https://bit.ly/ubep-rws-website](https://bit.ly/ubep-rws-website)), you can access the slides of the day and navigate them at your pace.

-   You can follow and navigate the presentation slides on your phone, tablet, or laptop from the web. When the presenter changes slides in their screen-shared (master) presentations, everyone will follow and see the same content on their device.

## R

-   A language: we write R code in the R language.

    ``` r
    two <- sum(1 + 1)
    ```

. . .

-   An Engine: able to execute computations, analyses, graphs, reports, ...

    ```{r}
    #| output-location: column
    library(tidyverse)

    mtcars |> 
      ggplot(aes(hp, mpg)) +
      geom_point(aes(colour = cyl)) +
      labs(
        x = "Gross horsepower",
        y = "Miles/(US) gallon",
        colour = "N cylinders"
      )
    ```

. . .

-   An Interpreter (that translates back-and-forth R code to executable code)

    -   When we *run* code in R language, the interpreter translates it for execution.
    -   When R has computed the results, the interpreter translates/prints it back to us.

    ```{r}
    sum(1:3)
    ```


## RStudio Cloud

-   A fully functional RStudio IDE on the cloud.

-   Free for you to use within the course workspace.[^3]

-   Once you join the workspace, you can enter the R project provided for the day.

-   The environment is already set for you

[^3]: You need a free account to join workspaces. If you didn't have one already, joining our workspace will first redirect to the sign up page. Link to join: [https://bit.ly/ubep-rws[-rstudio-registration-only]{style="color:darkorange;"}](https://bit.ly/ubep-rws-rstudio-registration-only).

::: columns
::: {.column width="35%"}
IDE = Integrated Development Environment (to work with R)

0.  side- and top-bar for workspaces and projects navigation.
